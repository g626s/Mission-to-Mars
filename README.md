# Project Overview

# Summary and Website Stylization using Bootstrap 3
HTML and CSS web scraping to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. Data is stored in a NoSQL database MongoDB, and then the data is rendered in a web application created with Flask to display the data from the web scrape. HTML/CSS portfolio was created to showcase the project. Bootstrap components used to polish and customize the portfolio.
